                                  <p class="textNormal">The Maintenance Scheduling and Feedback module consists of scheduling the Maintenance Tasks, creating Maintenance Work-Orders and recording Feedback on these Work-Orders without failing to register the Maintenance Delays, if any. </p>
                                  <p class="textNormal">The IPMS System categorizes Maintenance activity to be of two types - one concerned with the routine, daily jobs and the other concerned with all other periodic and one-time jobs. The daily routine Jobs are defined as the Daily Checklist Jobs. As these Jobs are done everyday, they are scheduled by each Facility for a period of time. The System generates a Work-Order for the defined period as well as a Task List for each Task under the Job. The maintenance crew can do the job as per the specified Task list and keep a record of the daily resources consumption required in order to complete the various Tasks. At the end of the specified period, Feedback on this Work-order can be recorded and the work-order can be closed. The system also provides for the generation of a list of the Daily Checklist Tasks on a particular date.</p>
                                  <p class="textNormal">It is possible that a Work Order, without a due date, is forwarded by a Facility. In such cases, the Jobs and Tasks will be defined but the Tasks will not have a Next Due Date specification. The System defines such Jobs as Backlog Jobs. The Systems provides the option of generating a Facility-wise list of Backlog Jobs, this will help in the future planning of the Job.</p>
                                  <p class="textNormal">The system provides for the Scheduling of Maintenance Tasks falling due within a specified scheduling period. The Tasks falling due are shown on the schedule and the successive dates, within the specified period, are calculated as per the frequency defined. These Tasks have to be selected by the planner as per the available resources. The planner is also given the option of synchronizing the due dates for different Tasks. While scheduling, the planner can view the Scheduled down Turn as well as the resources required for doing the particular Task. The system also displays the Spares and Craft availability.</p>
                                  <p class="textNormal">Once the planner has selected the Tasks, the system gathers the selected Tasks under their respective Jobs and creates Work-orders for each of the Jobs. The system also calculates the estimated Co<br />
                                    st for each of the Work-orders. After the Work-orders are authorized, they may be printed. The system also has the provision to assign tasks to particular men by linking the tasks to an employee number.</p>
                                  <p class="textNormal">It captures the Plant Delays by Facility. After the Maintenance work has been done, Feedback needs to be recorded for each of the Work-orders. The Feedback consists of general Feedback on the Job and Feedback on each of the Tasks. This feedback forms the maintenance history, from where the MIS can be generated and maintenance costs can be calculated. It also facilitates to capture the Failure Cause and Remedy in already interfaced MS Word File.</p>
